Object Detection using OpenCV – Mobilenet SSD

The Object Detection OpenCV method we use helps us to balance between speed and
accuracy with Mobilenet SSD algorithm. Unlike many other object detection methods, we
will be able to run this in real-time with a good amount of accuracy.
Prerequisites
- Visual Studio Code (or any code editor of your choice)
- Python
- OpenCV


These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the object detection system.

Object Detection
    1. Download the “Source Code” Folder.
    2. Open Visual Studio Code and Select Add Folder to Workspace option in the File
       Menu.
    3. Add the Object Detection folder to the Workspace by selecting in the Project
       Directory.
    4. Run the Object Description:
       4.1. For Pre-Trained Object Detection, execute “Obj Det PRETRAINED.py”.
       4.2. For Customized Object Detection, execute “Obj Det CUSTOMIZED.py”.
    5. The detection results will be displayed, providing information about the objects
       detected in the video feed
